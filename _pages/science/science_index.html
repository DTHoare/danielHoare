<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions are causing dangerous climate change. We must prevent as much additional warming as we can, and try to keep below 1.5c warming. To do this we must decrease emissions of greenhouse gases by a large amount, in a short timeframe - various governments and groups have different opinions on what a 'large amount' and a 'short timeframe' mean. But for any definition, to ensure a successful reduction in emissions we must know how much we are emitting.</p>

<p>This is where my current research comes in. Since 2018 I've been a post-graduate researcher in the Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group at the University of Bristol, working on using atmospheric measurements and inverse modelling to calculate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. My focus is on producing a new model for the London Greenhouse Gas project, which is installing a new network of measurement devices across London to measure city level emissions. The results from this project will be used to inform local policy makers and help them make the best decisions possible.</p>

<p>In the past my work has been in different areas. For my Masters research I developed numerical simulations of fusion plasmas at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy and during my undergraduate I operated and developed diagnostics for the Vulcan Petawatt laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.</p>
