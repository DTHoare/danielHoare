<h2>Development of an urban greenhouse gas modelling system to support a London monitoring network</h2> (Accepted 2020)

<p> Atmospheric transport models let us compare actual measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations and the expected concentrations caused by estimated emissions. This is one step in the process of top-down emissions monitoring - using atmospheric measurements to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions for an area. </p>

<p> These models are complex, and many factors can affect the performance of both the models and the measurements. To ensure we get the most accurate estimates of greenhouse gas emissions, we need to use the atmospheric transport models best suited to the task. In this study, we look at two different models, and test how well they model the measurements from a new monitoring site in central London.</p>
