<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>
<p>You have been studying as an apprentice adventurer for three years. Today you set off on your own for your final test, to prove you have what it takes to uncover the mysteries of the past.

<p>A monstrosity of stone and metal towers above you, reaching into the heavens. You feel a steady rhythm pounding through the earth beneath your feet. You stand at the entrance of one of the forgotten factories, a relic left behind by the Fallen Empire. Inside, vast amounts of advanced technology beyond your wildest dreams is waiting to be discovered.

<p>Good luck.
