    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "I'm a post-graduate researcher at the University of Bristol, studying new ways to monitor greenhouse gas emissions.
     I primarily work on the London GHG project, developing a new monitoring network to focus on London's carbon dioxide and methane emissions.
     Previously I have worked on fluid dynamic simulations of nuclear fusion plasmas, and helped operate one of the world's most powerful lasers.
     <br><br>I also really enjoy art, as a chance to see something beautiful, tell a great story or to express something that is hard to describe.
     In my own art I mostly work digitally, although I still paint from time to time. Currently I'm most interested in landscapes, animation, abstract, generative art and video games.
     <br><br>I built this website as a single place to share all my work, and provide extra thoughts I think could be helpful to others."
